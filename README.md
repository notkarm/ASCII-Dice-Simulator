Instructions to run it:
 1) Simply download the python file named "Dice.py"
 2) Run it by either double clicking on it or by going to the directory in your terminal and use "python3 dice.py"
 3) Congratulations! That is literally all you have to do it to run it. (Doesn't even make sense to make a README for it but here I am)
